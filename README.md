# Accenture-Data-Science-and-Visualization

The motive behind this presentation is to assist Social Buzz in preparing for a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) by enhancing their data management practices. As Social Buzz experiences rapid growth, it faces significant challenges in managing large-scale, unstructured data. Led by Managing Director Mae Mulligan, a team of Accenture experts embarked on a three-month project to audit current big data practices, analyze sample data, and provide strategic recommendations. The goal is to identify key content categories, stress test the company's technology, and deliver a comprehensive strategy for effective data management and IPO readiness. By demonstrating Accenture's value and expertise, this project aims to position Accenture as the go-to advisory firm for Social Buzz, ensuring they are well-prepared for their upcoming IPO and future growth.
